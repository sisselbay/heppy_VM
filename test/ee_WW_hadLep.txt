! This file contains commands to be read in for a Pythia8 run.
! Lines not beginning with a letter or digit are comments.
! Names are case-insensitive  -  but spellings-sensitive!
! The settings here are illustrative, not always physics-motivated.

! 1) Settings used in the main program.
Main:numberOfEvents = 1000         ! number of events to generate
Main:timesAllowErrors = 3          ! how many aborts before run stops

! 2) Settings related to output in init(), next() and stat().
Init:showChangedSettings = on      ! list changed settings
Init:showChangedParticleData = off ! list changed particle data
Next:numberCount = 100             ! print message every n events
Next:numberShowInfo = 1            ! print event information n times
Next:numberShowProcess = 1         ! print process record n times
Next:numberShowEvent = 0           ! print event record n times

! 3) Beam parameter settings. Values below agree with default ones.
Beams:idA = 11                     ! first beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:idB = -11                    ! second beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212


! 4) Hard process : WW, WW->had+lep, at 240 GeV

Beams:eCM = 240                    ! CM energy of collision

WeakDoubleBoson:ffbar2WW = on
!24:onMode = on

24:onMode = off
24:onIfMatch = 2 1		! uD

!24:onIfMatch = 2 3		! uS
!24:onIfMatch = 2 5		! uB
!24:onIfMatch = 4 1		! cD
!24:onIfMatch = 4 3		! cS
!24:onIfMatch = 4 5		! cB

24:onIfMatch = 13 14		! mu + nu_mu
!24:onIfMatch = 11 12		! e + nu_e
